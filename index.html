    <main>
        <p>Europe is also experiencing significant climate challenges. Here are some key points about the current climate situation in Europe:</p>

        <h2>1. Rapid Warming</h2>
        <p>Europe is warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s. In 2022, the region was approximately 2.3°C above the pre-industrial average.</p>

        <h2>2. Extreme Heat</h2>
        <p>The continent experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022, leading to thousands of heat-related deaths.</p>

        <h2>3. Drought and Wildfires</h2>
        <p>Severe drought conditions and wildfires were widespread, with Spain's water reserves dropping significantly.</p>

        <h2>4. Glacier Melt</h2>
        <p>Glaciers in Europe, particularly in the Alps, are melting at an unprecedented rate, losing about 880 cubic kilometers of ice from 1997 to 2022.</p>

        <h2>5. Marine Heatwaves</h2>
        <p>Sea surface temperatures around Europe reached new highs, impacting marine ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>6. Economic Impact</h2>
        <p>Climate-related hazards have caused significant economic losses, estimated at around half a trillion euros over the past 40 years.</p>

        <h2>7. Renewable Energy</h2>
        <p>On a positive note, renewable energy sources like wind and solar generated more electricity than fossil gas for the first time in 2022.</p>
